# Introduction

My name is Nathan Esquenazi and I am a developer that likes building products, 
participating in startups and the ideals of entrepreneurship. I also have a passion for open source,
web development, and executing new ideas. I am 25 as of the time of writing in 2012. 
Currently living in San Francisco and working as one of the first engineers at [Miso](http://gomiso.com).

**Note:** The quick summaries presented below are first, followed by
a more detailed story of my background.

# My Skills

Whenever I have been in a position to help grow the team for the startups I have worked at,
I put a lot of emphasis on understanding how much visibility potential hires
had into the depths of their own knowledge. I consider people that rank themselves
suspiciously high on any given skill to mark a "red flag" of sorts. In my experience so far, there
are very few exceptions to the 
[Dunning–Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

I figure then that it would only be fair for me to rank my own abilities on a few key skills 
_as they stand today_. I am going for accuracy here. An attempt to honestly 
evaluate my own skills (as hard as that can be).
The scale is from 1 (complete beginner, barely played with the skill) to 
10 (practical master, knows topic inside and out).
 
 * **Sinatra/Padrino**: 8
 * **Ruby**: 7
 * **Ruby on Rails**: 6
 * **API Development**: 6
 * **MiniTest** (unit tests): 6
 * **jQuery**: 6
 * **git**: 6
 * **Writing** (documentation): 6
 * **Agile Process**: 5
 * **Capybara** (integration tests): 5
 * **PostgreSQL**: 5
 * **HTML5/CSS3**: 5
 * **Javascript** (no framework): 4
 * **Interaction Design** (user experience): 4
 * **Python**: 3
 * **C# .NET** (Desktop) : 3
 * **Objective-C** (iPhone): 2
 * **Android**: 2
 * **Backbone**: 2
 * **Visual Design** (colors, layouts): 2
 * **VIM**: 1

I will be adding to this list and hopefully updating it in an ongoing effort to improve.

of my projects.

# My Story

Prior to working at Miso in San Francisco, I have had a history of working at early-stage startups. 
I'd like to include here a richer story of my background in software
development for those that are interested.

**Note:** This story is intentionally detailed. Please see above sections
for the more concise summary.

## The Early Years

I started programming when I was fairly young. My dad always
loved computers and he was showing me [Gopher](http://www.codeghost.com/gopher_history.html)
as early as 1993 when I was just 6 years old. When I was 9, My dad bought me 
[Lego Mindstorms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms) and 
I was soon introduced to VB6 (Visual Basic) and later to C++ by my uncle that was
working for Symantec as a developer at that time.

Lego Mindstorms and Visual Basic introduced me to the fundamental concepts of programming
but only when I started diving into C++ did I really begin to understand how deep the rabbit hole could go.
I also picked up HTML and CSS when I was 11 and began making (bad) websites for various
family members around 1998.

## High School and iPodSoft

In high school, having a background in programming, I decided to
enroll in a computer science offered to freshman and was introduced
to Pascal, Scheme and later Java. I continued along this path
and took every computer science class available at my high school.

My serious interests in development started in 2004, when I started my first company 
[iPodSoft](http://www.ipodsoft.com/site/pmwiki.php) in my 3rd year of high school. 
I reached out to a few other developers and established a marketplace for selling iPod-related software. 
With iPodSoft, I developed and sold multiple desktop and mobile softwares 
before the iPod had any connection to the internet. 

## iStory Creator

My favorite project I created with iPodSoft was 
called [iStory Creator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IStory), an interactive
storytelling mechanism for the iPod using the "Notes" features. I had
discovered that I could 'hack' the iPod Notes application
to allow me to create HTML hyperlinks and insert music. 

I [created a freeware software](http://forums.ilounge.com/ipod-classic-legacy-ipods/21018-interactive-games-istory-creator.html) 
to allow anyone to leverage this hyperlinking feature and
publish interactive stories that could be downloaded onto the iPod. 
I collected 150+ "iStories" on a variety of topics 
from many authors that I would make available for download on our website.

## Talking Panda

Shortly after I graduated high school in 2005, I was contacted by Jordan Allen-Dutton
because he wanted to acquire my software and hire me as the principal engineer to work at his startup 
[Talking Panda](http://www.talkingpanda.com/index.html). He also loved building
iPod software and we shared a vision of the future for an iPod filled
with interactive experiences and third-party developer-created applications. 

With Talking Panda, I built the successor to iStory Creator which we branded 
[iWriter](http://talkingpanda.com/iwriter) and worked on several other related products. 
iWriter was intended to be used as an educational and entertainment platform and
was experimented with by a few forward-thinking
universities including [Penn State](http://ets.tlt.psu.edu/white-papers/iwriter-hot-team-results/).
Our other educational software such as [iRocker](http://talkingpanda.com/irocker.php) became the 
[first third-party](http://www.macnn.com/reviews/ibar-and-irocker.html)
iPod software sold in official Apple retail stores. 

## Mogopop

We also worked together at Talking Panda towards a shared vision of an 'Online Software Store' 
for the iPod called [mogopop](http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/mogopop-inc-mogopopcom-beta/). 
We even spoke to Apple and met with several senior executives demonstrating the power
of the iPod with third-party software available online for education and entertainment. 
Little did we know when they seemed both interested and surprised
that not 6 months later, Apple would release the first iPhone and the app store.

## College Life

While I was a freshman in college at University of California at Irvine, I moved on 
from my first startup but I was hooked and began independently learning all about desktop, mobile and
web development. Executing products was fun and I realized this was
what I wanted to invest my time into. 

Classes and the academic theory were interesting to me but I couldn't resist my interest in startups.
Still, I found at that time a passion for education and curriculum. I became a tutor for several years
teaching CS fundamentals to freshman and sophomores. I also enjoyed helping
other classmates understand material having
myself entered college with 3 years of CS fundamentals and a 5 on the AP test
with the guidance of my high school teacher
[Bob Franz](http://www.lasv.org/laaefamily/advisors/rfranz.htm).

While I was in college, I was always working in the industry as well.
I did various freelancing jobs, explored multiple stacks and worked for several startups. This included my work with
[quub](http://techcrunch.com/2009/04/27/quub-a-micromessaging-service-that-asks-what-are-you-doing-and-means-it/)
where I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with one of my best professors from college, 
[Don Patterson](http://www.ics.uci.edu/faculty/profiles/view_faculty.php?ucinetid=djpatter).

## Olepta

In college, I started a company with my good friend [Thomas Shafer](https://github.com/growlypants) 
named Olepta, which was a turnkey scheduling solution for health professionals. 
We worked on that together for several years while in college, including coordinating with our professors
to allow us to get formal school credit for our work and turn our company into our senior class project.
We also applied to several business competitions on campus and got awarded prize money we used to
fund the operations of our small startup. Had a great time with Olepta and we ended up 
getting multiple patents several of which were ultimately acquired by [Ethicon-Endo](http://www.ees.com/).

## quub and Open Source

My senior year (in 2008), I was working with my professor on a startup called 'quub', my own 
startup we called Olepta and began falling in love with web development and working more seriously with Ruby. 
I started playing much more seriously with Rails and Sinatra and liking them both quite a bit. Started
focusing all of my time into that stack, opting to specialize rather than explore breadth-first
as I had been doing. Around this time, I decided to
[release](https://github.com/nesquena/wikipedia_search) a [few](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_notifier)
[simple](https://github.com/nesquena/conditions_fu) [projects](https://github.com/nesquena/prototype_animator)
which sparked my interest in the open-source community.

## Post-Graduation

In 2009, I graduated with a Bachelor's in "Informatics" from University of California at Irvine.
I also began working with a classmate [Arthur Chiu](https://github.com/achiu) and
started looking even closer at [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com), a ruby web micro-framework.
We began building tools for Sinatra to make web development easier and more powerful
and ultimately I released this open-source in a project called 
[sinatra-more](https://github.com/nesquena/sinatra_more). After a few months,
and multiple core contributors later, this quickly evolved into [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com/), 
the "godfather of Sinatra" which is 
[still being used](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/wiki/Projects-using-Padrino) 
today by many developers. Our team is still actively developing Padrino and
we are working towards a stable 1.0 release.

## Wrapping Up

For the duration of my 4 years as an undergraduate, I was working in startups and contracting 
with near full-time hours. I worked in desktop development (Java, .NET),
mobile development (Blackberry, Symbian, Android) and a ton of web development (ASP.NET, Java, PHP and Ruby).
Always focused on building things and learning more about all the many, many things I didn't know. 

Today, I am still focused on startups, executing products and full-stack web development.
Ruby and Sinatra/Padrino/Rails is my current stack of choice for realizing 
the implementations of any new ideas I need to validate or experiment with. I am 
still actively contributing to open-source, most recently with [RABL](https://github.com/nesquena/rabl)
which has been [gaining popularity](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/API_Builders) and
[backburner](https://github.com/nesquena/backburner) which is a reliable ruby work queue
powered by beanstalkd.
